# Genetic Algorithm

![Screenshot](1.png)


This project applied Genetic Algorithm in a salesman travel problem to optimize the path across 50 state capitols. 
It is a NP-hard problem to identify the best route across 50 state capitols in terms of distances. Therefore, to achieve a balance between computing resources (computing time, hardware demands) and business needs in the industry, I applied Genetic Algorithm to optimize the route planning and at the same time monitored the computing time. 

Applications of this route optimization problem in the industry can be:
  1. Logistic Network Planning 
  2. Delivery Service Company (UberEat, Doordash, etc)
  3. Package Good Delivery Service, etc
